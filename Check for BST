Given the root of a binary tree. Check whether it is a BST or not.

A BST is defined as follows:
The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with data less than the node's data.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with data greater than the node's data.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
Note: We are considering that BSTs can not contain duplicate Nodes.

Examples:
Input: root = [2, 1, 3, N, N, N, 5]

Output: true 
Explanation: The left subtree of every node contains smaller data and right subtree of every node contains greater data. Hence, the tree is a BST.
Input: root = [2, N, 7, N, 6, N, 9] 

Output: false 
Explanation: Since the node to the right of node with data 7 has lesser value 6, hence it is not a valid BST.
Input: root = [10, 5, 20, N, N, 9, 25]

Output: false
Explanation: The node with data 9 present in the right subtree has lesser key value than root node 10.
Constraints:
1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 105
1 ≤ node->data ≤ 109



Solution :

    def isBSTUtil(self, node, min_value, max_value):
        if node is None:
            return True
        
        if node.data < min_value or node.data > max_value:
            return False
            
        return (self.isBSTUtil(node.left, min_value, node.data - 1) and 
            self.isBSTUtil(node.right, node.data + 1, max_value))
        
    
    def isBST(self, root):
        return self.isBSTUtil(root, float('-inf'), float('inf'))
